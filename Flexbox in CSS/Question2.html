<!-- 1. justify-content:
   - Role: Determines how the child elements are distributed along the main axis (horizontal axis by default).
   - Values: 
     - `flex-start: Items are packed toward the start of the flex container.
     - flex-end: Items are packed toward the end of the flex container.
     - center: Items are centered along the line.
     - space-between: Items are evenly distributed in the container, with equal space around them.
     - space-around: Items are evenly distributed in the container, with equal space around them, including half-size spaces on the edges.
     - space-evenly: Items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.

2. align-items:
   - Role: Defines how the children are aligned on the cross axis (vertical axis by default).
   - Values: 
     - `flex-start: Cross-start margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-start line.
     - `flex-end: Cross-end margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-end line.
     - `center: Items are centered in the cross-axis.
     - `baseline: Items are aligned such that their baselines align.
     - `stretch: Stretch to fill the container (vertically).

3. gap:
   - Role: Sets the spacing between flex items.
   - Values: A length value (e.g., `10px`, `1em`), a percentage value (e.g., `5%`), or `normal`.
   - Note: `gap` is a shorthand property for `row-gap` and `column-gap` and can be used to set both gaps simultaneously.

4. flex-direction:
   - Role: Specifies the direction in which the flex container's main axis runs and how flex items are placed in the flex container.
   - Values: 
     - row: Main axis is horizontal, starting from the left.
     - row-reverse: Main axis is horizontal, starting from the right.
     - column: Main axis is vertical, starting from the top.
     - column-reverse: Main axis is vertical, starting from the bottom.

5. flex-wrap:
   - Role: Determines whether the flex container should wrap flex items onto multiple lines or not.
   - Values:
     - nowrap: All flex items are on one line (default behavior).
     - wrap: Flex items break into multiple lines if necessary.
     -wrap-reversw: Flex items break into multiple lines if necessary, but the cross-start and cross-end directions are swapped.

Understanding and utilizing these properties allows developers to create responsive and flexible layouts, making Flexbox a powerful tool in modern web design. -->
