<!-- CSS Flexbox Layout is designed for one-dimensional layout, either in a row or a column. It focuses on distributing space along a single axis and allows items to adjust their size dynamically. Flexbox offers powerful alignment and justification properties for both items and the container, making it easy to center items vertically and horizontally. It also enables you to change the visual order of elements without changing their position in the DOM using the `order` property.

CSS Grid Layout, on the other hand, is designed for two-dimensional layout, involving rows and columns. Grid layout allows you to create complex layouts by defining rows and columns and placing items within the cells formed by intersecting rows and columns. It provides precise control over the placement of items in both dimensions and offers properties for alignment, spacing, and track sizing. Grid layout is ideal for building responsive designs where items can be rearranged based on screen size and other factors.

When choosing between Flexbox and Grid, consider using Flexbox when you need to arrange items in a single dimension, want items to grow or shrink based on available space, need versatile alignment options, and are dealing with linear structures like navigation bars or lists. Use Grid when you require a two-dimensional layout, want precise control over item placement in rows and columns, need to create complex layouts, and want to build responsive designs with rearrangeable and resizable items. In some cases, you can use both Flexbox and Grid together within a layout to achieve specific design goals. -->
